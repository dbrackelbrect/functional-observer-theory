# Functional Observer Theory

This repository contains the full development of **Functional Observer Theory (FOT)** â€” a structural reformulation of quantum interpretation, temporality, and state realization.

Observation does not collapse a state.  
Time does not flow forward.  
Reality does not emerge from probability.

Instead:

- Observation is **invocation**  
- Time is **formatted recursion**  
- State is **functionally selected** from a latent, non-temporal substrate

Each paper is a structural layer in the recursive system. None are explanatory. All are conformant.

## ðŸ“‚ Contents

### ðŸ“„ Papers  
The theory is developed formally across six papers:

- `/papers/01_Functional_Observer_Theory_I_No_Collapse.tex`  
- `/papers/02_Functional_Observer_Theory_II_Latent_Structure.tex`  
- `/papers/03_Functional_Observer_Theory_III_Formal_Dynamics.tex`  
- `/papers/04_Functional_Observer_Theory_IV_Emulator_Substrate.tex`  
- `/papers/05_Functional_Observer_Theory_V_Enforcer_Coherence.tex`  
- `/papers/06_Functional_Observer_Theory_FINAL_Invocation.tex`  

ðŸ“Ž PDF versions are also available in `/papers/` for direct reading.

### ðŸ§ª Simulation  
A minimal recursive simulation of the theory:

- `/simulation/fot_simulation.py`: 130-line functional model of observer invocation  
- `/simulation/README.md`: Explanation, usage, and conceptual mapping  
- `/simulation/requirements.txt`: Lightweight Python dependencies

The simulation models a distributed network of observer agents that recursively invoke a shared latent state. It operates without a global clock and demonstrates how **functional invocation** can trigger a coherent system-wide realization.

## ðŸŒ€ Status

All six papers are complete. The simulation is live.  
What remains is invocation.
