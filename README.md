# Functional Observer Theory

This repository contains the full development of **Functional Observer Theory** â€” a structural reformulation of quantum interpretation, temporality, and state realization.

Observation does not collapse a state.  
Time does not flow forward.  
Reality does not emerge from probability.

Instead:

- Observation is **invocation**  
- Time is **formatted recursion**  
- State is **functionally selected** from a latent, non-temporal substrate

Each paper is a structural layer in the recursive system. None are explanatory. All are conformant.
