## Overview

This repository contains the formal publication of a speculative framework in quantum foundations.

**Functional Observer Theory (FOT)** proposes that quantum states do not collapse, branch, or probabilistically update. Instead, observation is modeled as a delta-preserving functional mapping applied by the observer — producing an interpretive state without altering the original.

Time emerges only through the observer's invocation of this function, not as an intrinsic property of the quantum substrate.

## Unified Framework

The core theory spans two papers:

### **I. Functional Observer Theory (FOT)**  
- The quantum state is invariant: no collapse, no destruction  
- The observer applies a function:  
  `F(ψ₀, IO) → ψf`  
- The result is an interpretive state, preserving the original via `δ = 0`  
- Time is not fundamental:  
  `T_state = undefined, T_O ∈ ℝ`  

### **II. Predictive Substrate Theory (PST)**  
- All interpretable states exist in a **timeless predictive substrate**  
- The observer extracts one via `F`, collapsing nothing  
- Time, space, and gravity emerge through recursive application of function  
- Gravity is not a force — it's **functional recursion**

**Key Principles:**
- Observation ≠ measurement  
- Collapse is reinterpreted as mapping  
- Delta-preservation defines continuity  
- Time and space are outputs, not inputs

## Abstract (from Paper I)

This paper introduces a delta-preserving interpretive model of quantum mechanics in which the observer neither collapses nor branches the quantum state. Instead, the observer applies a functional operation that produces a derivative interpretive state from the original configuration, preserving its identity δ.

Temporal flow is emergent, initiated by observer invocation. Unused state paths remain latent but functionally accessible. No ontological transformation occurs — only recontextualization.
