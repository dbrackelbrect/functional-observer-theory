## Overview

This repository contains the formal publication of a speculative framework in quantum foundations.

**Functional Observer Theory (FOT)** proposes that quantum states do not collapse, branch, or probabilistically update. Instead, observation is modeled as a delta-preserving functional mapping applied by the observer — producing an interpretive state without altering the original.

Time emerges only through the observer's invocation of this function, not as an intrinsic property of the quantum substrate.

## Abstract

**Paper I** introduces a delta-preserving interpretive model of quantum mechanics in which the observer neither collapses nor branches the quantum state. Instead, the observer applies a functional operation that produces a derivative interpretive state from the original configuration, preserving its identity $\delta$.

**Paper II** expands the model with predictive substrates that exist outside time, a constrained function space determined by the observer’s logic, and formalizes recursive functionality, gravitational analogues, and information bounds.
