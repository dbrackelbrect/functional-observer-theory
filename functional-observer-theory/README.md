This repository contains the formal release of a novel interpretive model in quantum mechanics. The theory rejects state collapse and branching, proposing instead that the observer executes a functional, delta-preserving operation which recontextualizes — but does not alter — the original quantum state.

## Overview

This framework proposes that time, interpretation, and observable interaction are emergent properties driven by the observer’s intent, not measurement. The delta function $\delta$ encodes the invariant identity of a quantum state across interpretive transformation.
